# unvisitify

Filters links from certain sources to unvis.it. This WebExtension mostly exists
for educational purposes, as I wanted to try out some of the components it's
made of (WebExtensions, JavaScript etc.).

## Usage
I do not currently intend to publish this WebExtension to any Addon sites. You
may however try it out through the following procedure in Firefox:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open "about:debugging" in Firefox
3. Use Load Temporary Add-on
4. Select manifest.json when prompted for a file
